# Resolved issues

Security and bug fixes in the Bolt 1.x release series.

## Loading bolt/executor is "breaking" gettext setup in spec tests

When Bolt is used as a library, it no longer loads code from r10k unless you explicitly `require 'bolt/cli'`.\([BOLT-914](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-914)\)

## Deprecated functions in stdlib result in Evaluation Error \(1.0.0\)

Manifest blocks will now allow use of deprecated functions from stdlib, and language features governed by the 'strict' setting in Puppet. \([BOLT-900](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-900)\)

## Bolt apply does not provide clientcert fact \(1.0.0\)

`apply_prep` has been updated to collect agent facts as listed inÂ [Puppet agent facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.0/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html#puppet-agent-facts). \([BOLT-898](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-898)\)

## C:\\Program Files\\Puppet Labs\\Bolt\\bin\\bolt.bat is non-functional \(1.0.0\)

When moving to Ruby 2.5, the .bat scripts in Bolt packaging reverted to hard-coded paths that were not accurate. As a result Bolt would be unusable outside of PowerShell. The .bat scripts have been fixed so they work from cmd.exe as well. \([BOLT-886](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-886)\)
