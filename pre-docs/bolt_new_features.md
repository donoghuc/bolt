## Inventory file version 2 \(1.18.0\)

An updated version of the inventory file, [version 2](inventory_file_v2.md), is now available for experimentation and testing. In addition to several syntax changes, this version enables setting a human readable name for nodes and dynamically populating groups from PuppetDB queries. This version of the inventory file is still in development and might experience breaking changes in future releases. \( [BOLT-1232](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1232)\)

## YAML plan validation \(1.18.0\)

YAML plan validation now alerts on syntax errors before plan execution. \([BOLT-1194](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1194)\)

## Rerun failed commands \(1.17.0\)

Bolt now stores information about the last failed run in a `.rerun.json` file in the Bolt project directory. You can use this record to target nodes for the next run using `--retry failure` instead of `--nodes`.

For repositories that contain a Bolt project directory, add `$boltdir/.last_failure.json` to `.gitignore` files.

Stored information may include passwords, so if you save passwords in URIs, set `save-failures: false` in your Bolt config file to avoid writing passwords to the `.rerun.json` file. \( [BOLT-843](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-843)\)

The local transport now accepts the `run-as`, `run-as-command`, and `sudo-password` options on non-Windows nodes. These options escalate the system user \(who ran `bolt`\) to the specified user, and behave like the same options using the SSH transport. `_run_as` can also be configured for individual plan function calls for the local transport. \( [BOLT-1052](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1052)\)

## `Localhost` target applies the `puppet-agent` feature \(1.16.0\)

When the target hostname is `localhost`, the `puppet-agent` feature is automatically added to the target, because the Puppet agent installed with Bolt is present on the local system. This functionality is available on all transports, not just the local transport. \( [BOLT-1200](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1200)\)

## Tasks use the Bolt Ruby interpreter only for `localhost` \(1.16.0\)

Bolt sets its own installed Ruby as the default interpreter for all `.rb` scripts running on `localhost`. Previously, this default was used on all commands run over the local transport; it's now used when the hostname is `localhost` regardless of the transport. \( [BOLT-1205](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1205)\)

## Fact indicates whether Bolt is compiling a catalog \(1.16.0\)

If Bolt is compiling a catalog, `$facts['bolt']` is set to `true`, allowing you to determine whether modules are being used from a Bolt catalog. \( [BOLT-1199](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1199)\)

## YAML plans \(1.15.0\)

You can now write plans in the YAML language. YAML plans run a list of steps in order, which allows you to define simple workflows. Steps can contain embedded Puppet code expressions to add logic where necessary. For more details about YAML plans, see [Writing plans in YAML](writing_yaml_plans.md#). For an example of a YAML plan in use, see the [Puppet blog](https://puppet.com/blog/new-era-dawns-today-bolt-now-supports-yaml). \( [BOLT-1150](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1150)\)

This version also adds analytics data collection about the number of steps and the return type of YAML plans. \( [BOLT-1193](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1193)\)

## Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 \(1.15.0\)

A Bolt package is now available for RHEL 8. \( [BOLT-1204](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1204)\)

## Improved load time \(1.15.0\)

Bolt startup is now more efficient. \( [BOLT-1119](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1119)\)

## Details about `Result` and `ResultSet` objects \(1.15.0\)

The `Result` and `ResultSet` objects now include information in the JSON output about the action that generated the result. \( [BOLT-1125](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1125)\)

## Inventory warning about unexepected keys \(1.15.0\)

## Support for Puppet device modules in a manifest block \(1.14.0\)

You can now apply Puppet code on targets that can't run a Puppet agent using the remote transport via a proxy. This is an experimental feature and might change in future minor \(y\) releases. \( [BOLT-645](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-645)\)

## Validation and error handling for invalid PCP tokens \(1.14.0\)

The PCP transport `token-file` configuration option now includes validation and a more helpful error message. \( [BOLT-1076](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1076)\)

## SMB file transfer on Windows \(1.13.0\)

When transferring files to a Windows host, you can now optionally use the SMB protocol to reduce transfer time. You must have either administrative rights to use an administrative share, like `\\host\C$`, or use UNC style paths to access existing shares, like `\\host\share`. You can use SMB file transfers only over HTTP, not HTTPS, and SMB3, which supports encryption, is not yet supported. \( [BOLT-153](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-153)\)

## Interpreter configuration option \(1.13.0\)

An `interpreters` configuration option enables setting the interpreter that is used to execute a task based on file extension.

## Updated project directory structure \(1.12.0\)

Within your project directory, we now recommend using a directory called `site-modules`, instead of the more ambiguously named `site`, to contain any modules not intended to be managed with a Puppetfile. Both `site-modules` and `site` are included on the default modulepath to maintain backward compatibility. \( [BOLT-1108](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1108)\)

## `bolt puppetfile show-modules` command \(1.12.0\)

A new `bolt puppetfile show-modules` command lists the modules, and their versions, installed in the current `Boltdir`. \( [BOLT-1118](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1118)\)

## `BoltSpec::Run` helpers accept options consistently \(1.12.0\)

## Improved out-of-the-box tasks \(1.9.0\)

The `package` and `service` tasks now select task implementation based on available target features while their platform-specific implementations are private. \( [BOLT-1049](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1049)\)

## Respect multiple PuppetDB `server_urls` \(1.9.0\)

Bolt now tries to connect to all configured PuppetDB`server_urls` before failing. \( [BOLT-938](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-938)\)

## Standard library functions \(1.8.0\)

Bolt now includes several standard library functions useful for writing plans, including:
-   `ctrl::sleep`
-   `ctrl::do_until`
-   `file::read`
-   `file::write`
-   `system::env`

See [Plan execution functions and standard libraries](plan_functions.md#) for details. \( [BOLT-1054](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1054)\)

## Save keystrokes on `modulepath`, `inventoryfile`, and `verbose` \(1.7.0\)

You can now use shortened command options for `modulepath` \(`-m`\), `inventoryfile` \(`-i`\), and `verbose` \(`-v`\). \( [BOLT-1047](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-1047)\)

## Remote tasks \(1.6.0\)

You can now run tasks on a proxy target that remotely interacts with the real target, as defined by the `run-on` option. Remote tasks are useful for targets like network devices that have limited shell environments, or cloud services driven only by HTTP APIs. Connection information for non-server targets, like HTTP endpoints, can be stored in inventory. \( [BOLT-791](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-791)\)

## `reboot` module plan \(1.6.0\)

Bolt now ships with the [`reboot` module](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot), and that module now provides a plan that reboots targets and waits for them to become available. \( [BOLT-459](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/BOLT-459)\)
