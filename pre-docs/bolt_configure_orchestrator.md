# Using Bolt with Puppet Enterprise

If you're a Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) customer, you can configure Bolt to use the PE orchestrator and perform actions on managed nodes. Pairing PE with Bolt enables role-based access control, logging, and visual reports in the PE console.

For details about using Bolt with PE, see the [PE orchestrator documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/bolt_configure_orchestrator.html).
