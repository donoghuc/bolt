# Directory structures for tasks and plans

Puppet tasks, plans, functions, classes and types must exist inside a Puppet, module in order for Bolt to load them. Bolt loads modules by searching for module directories on the modulepath.

By default, the `modulepath` includes the `modules/` and `site-modules` directories in the [Bolt project directory](bolt_project_directories.md#).

## Directory structure of a module

A module is a sub-directory of one of the directories on the modulepath. In order for Bolt to load tasks and plans, they must exist in the `tasks/` or `plans/` directory of a module with the correct name.

**Tip:** You can use the Puppet Development Kit \(PDK\) to create modules and add tasks to it.

A typical module for use with Bolt may contain these directories:

```console
├── data/
├── files/
├── hiera.yaml
├── lib/
├── manifests/
├── metadata.json
├── plans/
└── tasks/
```

|Directory|Contents|
|---------|--------|
|`data`|Hiera data that can be used when applying a manifest block.|
|`files`|Static files that can be loaded by a plan or required as a dependency of a task. Prefer putting non-Ruby libraries used by a task here.|
|`functions`|Puppet language functions that can be used from a plan.|
|`hiera.yaml`|Hiera configuration for this module.|
|`lib`|Typically Ruby code, such as custom Puppet functions, types, or providers.|
|`manifests`|Classes and other Puppet code usable when applying a manifest block.|
|`metadata.json`|Typical metadata for a module describing version, operating system compatibility, and other module dependencies.|
|`plans`|Plans, which must end in the `.pp` extension.|
|`tasks`|Tasks and their metadata.|

### Where to put module code

Modules can either be written directly in `site-modules/` or be installed from the Puppet Forge or a code repository into `modules/`.

## Modules for projects

Modules developed to support a particular project can be developed directly in the `site-modules` directory of the Bolt project directory.

Create a new directory for each module inside `site-modules` that matches the modules name or use `pdk new module` to create a skeleton structure.

## Standalone modules

Standalone modules can be published to the Forge or saved in a shared code repository so that modules can be used from multiple projects or shared publicly.

To use a standalone module, [install the module](bolt_installing_modules.md#) into the project directory.

To create a standalone module, run `pdk new module` outside of the project directory, develop the module, then push it to a code repository or the Forge before using it in your project.

Follow these tips for managing standalone modules:

-   Add `modules/*` to `.gitignore` of your project to prevent accidentally committing standalone modules.
-   When you run tasks and plans within a project directory, the modulepath \(`modules/` and `site-modules/`\) is searched for modules containing Bolt content. If a module is found in `modules`, tasks and plans from the version of the module in `site-modules` are ignored. Remove a module from `site-modules` if you convert it to a standalone module.
-   As a best practice, write automated tests for the tasks and plans in your module, if possible.
