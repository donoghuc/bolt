title: Welcome to GitHub

Welcome back! The reception to the last developer update was so positive (ie. nobody complained) that we're back with another one.

The big news this week is Bolt 1.29.0, following hotly on the footsteps of last week's 1.28.0 release.

This release is a little leaner than last week, but continues with the HashiCorp improvements, adding remote state support to the Terraform inventory plugin.

Speaking of plugins, we're continuing to evolve the plugin system. Check out the proposals to [clean up "lookup" plugin evaluation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues/1147) and [load plugins from modules](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues/1133) and let us know what you think.

As you may see from those links, we're in the midst of migrating Bolt's project tracking from Jira to GitHub. If you want to see what we're scheming up or have an issue to file, [GitHub](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues) is the place to do it.
