title: Keep on pluggin'
---

Hello from Bolt developer land!

We currently have a slew of large plugin-related features in flight, which means this week's release has just a couple of bug fixes and improvements.

**Coming soon**

We're reworking the [API for interacting with Target objects](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues/1125) from within a plan to make it easier to dynamically create Targets and to change their config during a plan run.

One of our most requested features, the ability to [control how `apply_prep` installs Puppet on targets](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues/1123), is in progress now.

Also on the plugin front, we have both an [Azure inventory integration](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues/1148) in the works as well as the ability to [add new plugins via Puppet modules](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/issues/1133).

Look for those features to be landing in releases over the next couple of weeks.
