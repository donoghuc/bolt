You can use Bolt to run arbitrary commands on a set of remote hosts. Let's see that in practice before we move on to more advanced features. Choose the exercise based on the operating system of your test nodes.

## Prerequisites
Complete the following before you start this lesson:

- [Installing Bolt](../01-installing-bolt)
- [Setting Up Test Nodes](../02-acquiring-nodes)

## Running Shell Commands on Linux Nodes

Bolt by default uses SSH for transport. If you can connect to systems remotely, you can use Bolt to run shell commands. It reuses your existing SSH configuration for authentication, which is typically provided in `~/.ssh/config`.

To run a command against a remote Linux node, use the following command syntax:
```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes <nodes>
```

To run a command against a remote node using a username and password rather than keys use the following syntax:
```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes <nodes> --user <user> --password <password>
```

Run the `uptime` command to view how long the system has been running. If you are using existing nodes on your system, replace `node1` with the address for your node.

```shell
bolt command run uptime --nodes node1
```

The result:
```
Started on node1...
Finished on node1:
  STDOUT:
     22:42:18 up 16 min,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.03
Successful on 1 node: node1
Ran on 1 node in 0.42 seconds

```

> **Tip:** If you receive the error `Host key verification failed` make sure the correct host keys are in your `known_hosts` file, set `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` in your SSH config, or pass `--no-host-key-check` to future Bolt commands.

Run the 'uptime' command on multiple nodes by passing a comma-separated list. If you are using existing nodes on your system, replace `node1,node2,node3` with addresses for your nodes.

```shell
bolt command run uptime --nodes node1,node2,node3
```

The result:
```
Started on node1...
Started on node3...
Started on node2...
Finished on node2:
  STDOUT:
     21:03:37 up  2:06,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.03
Finished on node3:
  STDOUT:
     21:03:37 up  2:05,  0 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.03, 0.05
Finished on node1:
  STDOUT:
     21:03:37 up  2:07,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
Successful on 3 nodes: node1,node2,node3
Ran on 3 nodes in 0.52 seconds
```

## Running PowerShell Commands on Windows Nodes

Bolt can communicate over WinRM and execute PowerShell commands when running Windows nodes. To run a command against a remote Windows node, use the following command syntax:

```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes winrm://<node> --user <user> --password <password>
```

Note the `winrm://` prefix for the node address. Also note the `--username` and `--password` flags for passing authentication information. In addition, unless you have set up SSL for WinRM communication, you must supply the `--no-ssl` flag. Otherwise running a Bolt command will result in an `unknown protocol` error.

```shell
bolt command run <command> --no-ssl --nodes winrm://<node>,winrm://<node> --user <user> --password <password>
```

Run the following command to list all of the processes running on a remote machine. Note that this command uses the `windows` group defined in the `inventory.yaml` file. Since the inventory file is configured to not use SSL, the `--no-ssl` flag is not needed.

```shell
bolt command run "gps | select ProcessName" --nodes windows
```

Use the following syntax to list all of the processes running on multiple remote machines.

```shell
bolt command run <command> --nodes winrm://<node>,winrm://<node> --user <user> --password <password>
```

## Next Steps
